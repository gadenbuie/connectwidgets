## Installation

This package has not been released to CRAN yet and must be installed from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rstudio/rscpages")
```

## Example

Use the template:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::draft("example-page.Rmd", template = "rscpages", package = "rscpages")
```

You can also copy and knit the following example, or read on for more details:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}`r ''`
library(rscpages)
library(dplyr)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)

client <- connect(
  # server  = Sys.getenv("CONNECT_SERVER"),
  # api_key = Sys.getenv("CONNECT_API_KEY")
  )

all_content <- client %>%
  content()

sample_content <- all_content %>%
  arrange(desc(updated_time)) %>%
  slice_head(prop = .3)
```

### Setup

The client object:

- Validates your API key with the RStudio Connect server
- Ensures you are running a recent enough version of Connect

Use an `.Renviron` file to set the `CONNECT_SERVER` and `CONNECT_API_KEY`
environment variables.
RStudio Connect will [automatically apply](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/news/#rstudio-connect-188)
values for these at document run time,
so there is no need to include them in your code:

```{r}
library(rscpages)
library(dplyr)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)

client <- connect(
  # server  = Sys.getenv("CONNECT_SERVER"),
  # api_key = Sys.getenv("CONNECT_API_KEY")
  )

all_content <- client %>%
  content()

glimpse(all_content)

sample_content <- all_content %>%
  arrange(desc(updated_time)) %>%
  slice_head(prop = .3)
```

#### `content()`

`content()` returns a data frame with the following columns:

* `id` - Auto-incrementing identifier for each content item (legacy)
* `guid` - Unique identifier for each content item (preferred)
* `app_mode` - The type of the content item (examples: `shiny`, `rmd-static`, `static`, `python-dash`, etc.)
* `content_category` - For `static` app modes, the specific category of content (examples: `site`, `plot`, `pin`, etc.)
* `name` - The name of the content item as set at initial publishing
* `title` - The user-provided title of the content item
* `description` - The user-provided description of the content item
* `url` - The URL to the content item
* `owner_guid` - Unique identifier of the owner of the content item
* `owner_username` - Username of the owner of teh content item
* `owner_first_name` - First name of the owner of the content item
* `owner_last_name` - Last name of the owner of the content item
* `tags` - A data frame of the tags associated with the content item, with the following columns: `id`, `name`, `parent_id`, `created_time`, `updated_time`.
* `created_time` - The timestamp at which the content item was created
* `updated_time` - The timestamp at which the content item was last updated

#### Filtering Content

We provide helper functions to filter by both owners and tags.

- `by_tags()` - Filters the data frame to only include content that has been
tagged with the specified tag name(s).  You can pass a single tag name or a vector
of tag names. `by_tag` is provided as an alias for readability when using a
single tag.

- `by_owners()` - Filters the data frame to only include content with the
specified owner(s) by username.  You can pass a single username or a vector of
usernames. `by_owner` is provided as an alias for readability when using a
single username.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
all_content %>% 
  by_tag("Audit Reports")
```

Since `all_content` is a `tibble()`, you can also manipulate it with dplyr:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
all_content %>% 
  filter(updated_time >= "2021-01-01") %>% 
  arrange(created_time)
```


### Components

Once your content data are filtered, `rscpages` provides components for
displaying information about them. The title, description, and preview image can be set
[from the RStudio Connect dashboard.](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/content-settings/#content-metadata)
For content deployed to Connect where no image has been supplied, a default image will be used.

*Note:* In many cases, you will only see default images until your content is deployed.

#### card

Use a card to highlight an individual piece of content:

![a sample card](man/figures/README-card-1.png)

#### grid

Display multiple content items via a grid:

![a sample grid](man/figures/README-grid-1.png)

#### table

Provide a more detailed view with table:

![a sample table](man/figures/README-table-1.png)

#### search & filter

The search and filter components help viewers find the content they are most interested in.
You must pass the same content data frame to `rscsearch()`, `rscfilter()`,
and `rsctable()` or `rscgrid()` in order for filter and search to work.
You can also create your own `crosstalk::SharedData()` object to pass to
the components if you want more control over searching and filtering.
